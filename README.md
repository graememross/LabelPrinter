# LabelPrinter
A system to allow you to edit and create Labels for a Dymo labelwriter

Recently a local charity shop was given a Dymo Labelwriter (ok the print feed was clogged and it needed cleaning - but it worked fine)

Unfortunately all they had in the way of computing power was an old PC and some tablets - none of which would have hosted the software necessary to drive the printer.

I had a spare raspbery PI lying about so I decided the best approach was to use it as a print server and create a small web site which would allow browser based creation of labels and printing from the browsers (they can use their tablets to create and print the labels).

This project is the small web site which enables the creation and printing of the labels.
